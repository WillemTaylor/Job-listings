# Job-listings Challenge

This front-end coding challenge was taken from
https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt.

### The Challenge

Within this repo, I have created a job listing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I used Vue.js framework, with a mixture of SCSS and HTML to achieve the styling of this design, and javascript to acheive the functionality.

### What it does

You should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on your device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

### Filtering

I used a provided [data.json](./data.json) file to pull the data and then dynamically add the content to the site- hence creating the job-listing 'tiles'.

To add a filter, you'll need to click on the keywords within the tiles. For each filter added, only listings containing all the selected filters will be returned.
